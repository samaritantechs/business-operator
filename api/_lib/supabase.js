/* =====================================================================================
   A DATABASE FUNCTION IS CAPPED EXACTLY LIKE A TABLE READ, AND NOTHING WAS PAGING IT.

     "i wonder why use sampling in a list that needs them all .. i fear many defaulters havent
      been reached in app followup by now"

   That fear was right, and this is where it came from. fetchAll has always paged past
   PostgREST's silent 1000-row cap for ordinary reads -- it is the first thing this file
   explains. Every `db.rpc(...)` call in the system was a bare single request, and PostgREST
   applies THE SAME CAP to a function that returns a set. No error, no warning: row 1001 onward
   simply is not there.

   The team-day totals function is the one that hurts. A week of defaulter decks is seven days
   times forty teams times seven weekdays times two types -- getting on for four thousand
   summary rows, of which a thousand came back. The weekly report and the dashboard have been
   adding up a truncated set, and the per-team date map built on it silently lost every team
   whose row fell past the cap, which is precisely "a team is in the file but nowhere on the
   screen".

   So RPC gets what table reads have always had. Same page size, same stop condition -- a short
   page means the end -- and the same one-at-a-time discipline, because a wave of concurrent
   pages is what exhausted the connection pool the last time somebody tried it.

   A CLIENT THAT CANNOT PAGE IS STILL ANSWERED. `.range()` exists on the real PostgREST builder;
   anything else gets one plain call rather than an exception.

   THAT CHECK COSTS NOTHING, and it took a failing test to make it so. The first version built a
   throwaway `db.rpc(...)` purely to look for `.range` on it. On the real client that is free --
   nothing is sent until the builder is awaited -- but it is still one more call than the work
   needs, and the speed guards count calls, not awaits. They were right to. So the capability is
   read off the SAME builder the page is about to be sent on: if it cannot range, that builder is
   returned as it stands and its one answer is the whole answer. */

    paginating with .range() until a page comes back short of a full page (the sign nothing's
    left). Takes a function that BUILDS the query, not a query object -- .range() needs to apply
    to a fresh copy each page, not a query that's already been sent. */
/** Pages until a short page arrives -- ONE PAGE AT A TIME, deliberately.

    A wave of six concurrent page requests was tried and reverted the same day. It made each
    individual read finish sooner, but every screen fires several of these at once, and with
    200+ users on a live system the multiplied concurrency exhausted the database's connection
    pool: logins started failing with "failed to fetch", Settings would not open, and the
    data-heavy tabs errored. Latency per read is a smaller problem than the whole system
    falling over, so this stays sequential.

    The real fix for a slow read is to ask for FEWER ROWS AND FEWER COLUMNS, which is what the
    narrowed selects do -- not to ask for the same excess faster. */
/* FEWER, BIGGER PAGES -- not more of them at once.

   Asking for a thousand rows at a time meant thirty separate journeys to the database for one
   snapshot of thirty thousand customers, each one a full HTTPS round trip from Vercel. The
   dashboard needed 567 of them. At 150ms apiece that is eighty-five seconds of waiting before
   a single figure is worked out, and the platform gives up at sixty.

   The fix is NOT to fire them in parallel -- that was tried and it took the whole system down
   (see above). It is to make each journey carry more. Ten thousand rows in one request costs
   barely more than one thousand: the same round trip, a bigger body.

   PostgREST may be configured with a lower ceiling than we ask for, and it enforces it
   SILENTLY -- a truncated page with no error, which is what once made two different tables
   both report exactly 1000. So the ceiling is LEARNED rather than assumed: if the first page
   comes back at a round number below what was asked for, that number becomes the page size for
   the rest of this read, and paging continues correctly from there. Asking for more than the
   server allows is therefore safe, and asking for less than it allows is just slow. */

   A PAGED READ NEEDS A TOTAL ORDER, OR THE PAGES DO NOT FIT TOGETHER.
   =====================================================================================
   Reported from the field, and it is the most corrosive kind of bug there is:

     "The dashboard reads different stats after every visit or refresh without even any
      update being uploaded."

   Nothing was being uploaded and nothing was random in our arithmetic. The randomness was in
   the DATABASE, and it is documented behaviour rather than a fault.

   `offset`/`limit` slice a result set by POSITION. Postgres only promises a position when the
   query says ORDER BY -- without one it is free to hand rows back in whatever order the plan
   happens to produce, and that order is not stable between two separate statements. It is
   least stable on exactly the tables this matters for: `synchronize_seqscans` is on by default,
   so a sequential scan over a big table starts wherever another scan already in flight has got
   to, and finishes by wrapping round. Two users refreshing at once therefore get two DIFFERENT
   orderings of the same unchanged rows.

   Page 1 is then rows 0-9,999 of one ordering and page 2 is rows 10,000-19,999 of a different
   one. Some customers arrive twice and others not at all -- so the total moves every refresh,
   by a plausible-looking amount, with no error anywhere and nothing in the data to blame. It
   also explains the shape of the complaint that came with it: figures that look "abnormal"
   rather than obviously broken.

   The fix is to give every paged read a tiebreaker on a column that is UNIQUE, which pins the
   ordering down completely. It is added AFTER whatever the caller already ordered by, so the
   caller's own sort still decides and this only settles the ties -- which is the only place
   the ambiguity ever was.

   COST. Sorting is not free, but it is small next to what these reads already do: a sort of ten
   thousand rows costs a few milliseconds, against the tens of milliseconds it takes merely to
   serialise them and put them on the wire. Where the tiebreaker is the primary key, Postgres can
   often walk the index and not sort at all.

   IF THE SERVER WILL NOT ACCEPT THE ORDER -- an un-migrated table that has no `id` yet, a view,
   a column renamed -- the read falls back to exactly what it did before: unordered, one page at
   a time. A tiebreaker that cannot be applied must never turn a working screen into an error. */
